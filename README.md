In this project I have used CircleCI to implement CI/CD
I have:
- Lint run 
- Built a docker image
- Pushed the image to my personal docker repository
- Created a kubernetes (EKS) cluster in AWS
- Deployed the docker container application to this cluster
- Tested the application
- Delete the cluster following successful execution
